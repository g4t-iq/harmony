## About Harmony

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Harmony framework. If you want to build an application using Harmony, visit the main [Harmony repository](https://github.com/harmony/harmony).

Harmony is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Harmony attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://harmony.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://harmony.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://harmony.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://harmony.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://harmony.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://harmony.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://harmony.com/docs/broadcasting).

Harmony is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation gives you a complete toolset required to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Learning Harmony

Harmony has the most extensive and thorough documentation and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework. The [Harmony documentation](https://harmony.com/docs) is in-depth and complete, making it a breeze to get started learning the framework.
